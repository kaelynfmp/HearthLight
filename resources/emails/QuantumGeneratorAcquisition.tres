I have recently come into possession of something immensely valuable. I do not know how, but the [res=Quantum Generatormachine[/res] that is next to me as I write this very message is quietly humming away, generating a seemingly endless supply of electricity. I do now know how it is doing this, nor do I wish to know. Having this... [res=Quantum Generator]beast[/res] around is putting me on edge. I am worried that, at any moment, a paddywagon will roll up to my estate and take the existence of such a device as a threat. Keeping it with me does nothing but put me on edge, and as much as I would like to keep a stiff upper lip about all this, I must admit that this is too much for me to handle.

I have gathered through the grapevine that you are associated with a group that will certainly be able to make better use of [res=Quantum Generator]this device[/res] than I, and I am certain that they are also much better equipped to deal with the consequences than I.

I would ask, however, that you provide me with some generators. I'm afraid that plugging [res=Quantum Generator]this monstrosity[/res] into my home electricity grid instantaneously wiped out all of my existing generators.

Thank you, and please help,
Ernest"
