You've proven yourself competent and dependable time and again, and so I feel that I owe it to you to provide you with some capital, though not until you do me one small favour. Something has happened rather suddenly, and now I find myself entirely bereft of materials. I was hoping that you would be able to assist me in this department by procuring me some [res=Metal]metal[/res]. I have plenty of money that I will provide you with, I just need this one favour. After that I'll be out of your hair. Unless you're interested in future opportunities, that is.

Many thanks,
Ernest"
