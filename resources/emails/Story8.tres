They're severely malnourished because of my crippling gambling addiction. I don't visit them because I know I'm a bad influence, but I'm worried that I'll never see them again. The last thing I said to my eldest is that I wish he's never been born because then at least life would be bearable. I don't want that to be the last thing I ever said to him. 

Please.

I don't want them to get hurt."
