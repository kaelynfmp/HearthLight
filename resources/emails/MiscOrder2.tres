I will be attending a function tomorrow night, and I am trying to procure some reasonable enhancements to the experience. To that end, I was wondering if I could trouble you to provide me with some [res=Dust]fractured stone pieces of minimal size[/res]. I will kindly ask that you not inquire as to what I will be doing with these materials, as I can assure you that all of it is strictly within the bounds of the law. You will, of course, be compensated for your trouble.

Your cooperation and silence would both be appreciated.

Kindly,
Clarence"
