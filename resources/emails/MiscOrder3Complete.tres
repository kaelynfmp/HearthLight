I might not be able to be this mellow all the time, but if it's for the sake of Greta, then it's worth it. She's such a wonderful woman.

Anyways, I've sent some of my [res=Water]bong water[/res] your way as thanks. Hopefully you can find a use for it, since I can't exactly just dump it, what with the weed that's in it now.

sorry!"
