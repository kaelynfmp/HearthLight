The cannabis that I can find is much too pure to use by itself in a bong, and I need something else with a more neutral quality to dilute the toke, so that I can be where I need to be for my wife Greta.

For this reason, I was wondering if you could provide me with some [res=Cotton]cotton[/res]. I have found this to be an ideal additive. It lets me consistently get to where I need to be for my wife Greta with just one and a half tokes.

I am looking forward to your response, and especially to the heightened mood of my wife Greta."
