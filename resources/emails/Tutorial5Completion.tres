I can't say how pleased I am to have come to know someone as dependable as you. For now you have provided me with some resources most essential, for which I am deeply grateful. I look forward to corresponding with you further, but those requests will be less frequent, and of a far less urgent nature. To a bright future for our partnership!

Many thanks,
Ernest"
