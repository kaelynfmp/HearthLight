I have recently come into possession of a number of [res=GMO Seed]strange plant seeds[/res]. I, of course, need to keep a number of them for myself to perform tests on and see if they're of any interest to my compatriots and I, but I could be persuaded to lose a few of them in your general direction if you're willing, though I am not made of money, and would appreciate a charitable donation were something like that come to pass.

I'm not entirely sure what they are as of yet, but I am certain that you will be able to find a use for them.
Take care,
Ernest"
