I have recently come into possession of a [res=Nutrient Injection Pot]strange gardening pot[/res]. I, of course, have reverse-engineered one for myself and my compatirots, but I could be persuaded to lose one in your general direction if you're willing, though reverse-engineering this was neither cheap nor easy, so I would appreciate some materials if you might be so kind.

I'm not entirely sure what nutrients they inject into the plant yet, but I am certain that you will be able to find a use for whatever results.

Take care,
Ernest"
