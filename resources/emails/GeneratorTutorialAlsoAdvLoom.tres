It has only just occurred to me that you've been working with nothing but antiquated, hand-operated machinery. That cannot be allowed to stand! To have a confederate perform their artisanry in such barbaric conditions is a tragedy, and I will not allow it to stand!
Is what I [i]would[/i] say, if I didn't still need you to procure something for me.

My apologies, but it is simply of the utmost import. I am in need of some [res=Cotton]materials[/res] with which I might be able to [res=Metal]light a fire[/res]. Do not be alarmed! I simply need to be able to restart my [res=Generator]generator[/res]s. They run on [res=Coal]coal[/res], after all.

The damned capriciousness of these [res=Generator]machines[/res]. I could swear that [b]every night they shut off[/b]. Or mayhaps they simply don't transmit their power? Whatever it is, it has caused me no end of annoyances. With any measure of luck you won't have to deal with the inconveniences and frustrations, but I figured was obligated to at least warn you. 

As I mentioned above, it is abosultely criminal that you are still utilizing those old antiques. It is time to bring you forward in time, to industrialize your machinery. As such, I have included a [res=Motorized Loom]more advanced device[/res] to aid you in your quest towards manufaturing greatness. It will need to be placed [b]within proximity of the [res=Generator]generator[/res][/b]

Many thanks and well wishes,
Ernest"
