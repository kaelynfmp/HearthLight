My wife's been all sorts of excited recently. I'm not really sure what's gotten into her, but she's been a lot more... whimsical recently. I'm really happy for her, and she seems like she's back to being who he was when we got married, but I don't really get why she's changed like this all of a sudden. I guess she found her second wind and I couldn't. I feel like a failure.

Anyways, she really wants to do some sewing to make a teddy bear for our daughter, but she's been having trouble getting her hands on anything that, in her words \"won't hurt the little one later in life.\" I figured I could at least help her out a bit here. I guess I'm just worried that she's gonna leave me behind. She's so full of energy and, for lack of a better word, life. I don't want to hold her back. Is there any chance you've got [res=Fabric]anything for sewing[/res]?

I know this is kind of a shot in the dark, but thanks for at least hearing me out,
Twilight"
