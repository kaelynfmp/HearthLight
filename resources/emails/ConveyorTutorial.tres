I've come across a magnificent little piece of machinery that I think you'll find quite the use for. It's an old [res=Conveyor Belt]conveyor belt[/res]. It probably hasn't seen any use in quite some time, but I can imagine it might be a rather useful little gadget for you operation, given that [b]they're used to move things between machines[/b].

Unfortunately, in order to acquire this piece of machinery, I had to make a trade with some... unscrupulous fellows. I'm afraid that if I don't provide them with fine silks, or [res=Fabric]a convincing imitation[/res], then I will be forever indebted to them and their heinous organization. As-is, my collection of fine silks is running rather dry, and I [i]might[/i] have spent slightly more on their other products than I was able to pay, so I was hoping you might be able to help me out. A little quid pro quo, as it were.

Thank you for understanding,
Ernest"
