I personally dug your application to my research program out of our communal, eco-friendly rubbish bin to examine it after hearing rumours of your works. I have recently invented, as part of my numerous research escapades, a device I believe will revolutionize the world as it stands.

Of course, there is but one problem with this: if I send this to a manufactory, the greedy eyes of their workers will no doubt steal the product of my endless labour for their own desires. This cannot do.

Thus, it comes upon me to ask help of an entrepeneur such as yourself. I have attached to this email the schematics to build [res=Teleporter]a device like never before seen[/res]. Simply send the [res=Metal]metal[/res], and some minor amounts of [res=Dust]dust[/res] for chip processing, following the instructions of the schematic, and I will upload the relevant software and send the device, fully functional, back to you.

Sincerely yours,
Professor Goodman
PhD, University of Penumbra"
