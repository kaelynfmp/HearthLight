Given your stellar performance with regards to my previous request, I shall delay no more in once again requesting your services. I am in need of some [res=Ore]raw metal[/res]. How you acquire this [res=Metal]metal[/res] is none of my concern, though the simplest way would probably be to [b]process some kind of [res=Dust]stone dust[/res][/b] in something like a [res=Sieve]sieve[/res]. There are most certainly other ways, but [b]processing [res=Dust]stone dust[/res] in a [res=Sieve]sieve[/res][/b] is by far the most accessible, even though you would still require some kind of [res=Fabric]filter[/res], as well as some [res=Water]water[/res], although that, I can only hope, shouldn't be an issue for you.

With high hopes,
Ernest Hayden"
